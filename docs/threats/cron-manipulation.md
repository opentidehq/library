## Description
Suspicious cron activity refers to the insertion or modification of scheduled tasks
(cron jobs) on Unix-like systems (including Linux and macOS) in order to achieve 
or maintain unauthorized persistence. This technique takes advantage of the legitimate 
cron scheduling service to run malicious commands at regular intervals.  

In practice, a threat actor will add a hidden or obfuscated entry to `/etc/crontab`, 
user-specific cron files (e.g., `/var/spool/cron/`), or 
system-wide cron directories (e.g., `/etc/cron.d/`). 
These hidden entries often execute scripts that download additional malware, 
exfiltrate data, or establish a persistent backdoor.

Some known threat actors has leveraged cron-based jobs to deploy cryptocurrency miners 
and move laterally within compromised environments, often targeting cloud-based 
or containerized setups. 
Attackers have also been identified using stealthy cron modifications to maintain 
a foothold on victim systems, execute remote commands, and ensure that malicious binaries 
are relaunched even after a reboot.

## Criticality
**High** - A High priority incident is likely to result in a demonstrable impact to public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence.

## Terrain
> **Threat actor must already have privileged or administrative-level access 
on a Linux or Unix-like system to insert or modify cron entries.

## Threat Assessment
| Dimension | Assessment | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Severity | Substantial incident | A cyber attack which has a serious impact on a medium-sized organisation, or which poses a considerable risk to a large organisation or wider / local government. |
| Impact | Data Breach; Business disruption; Operating costs; Reputational Damages | - |
| Leverage | Dwelling; Modify configuration; Elevation of privilege | - |
| Viability | Likely | Probable (probably) - 55-80% |
| Kill Chain | Persistence | Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system. |

The group as been active since at least October 2019 and has mainly focused its efforts on leveraging cloud and container resources to deploy cryptocurrency miners in victim environments.(Citation: Palo Alto Black-T October 2020)(Citation: Lacework TeamTNT May 2021)(Citation: Intezer TeamTNT September 2020)(Citation: Cado Security TeamTNT Worm August 2020)(Citation: Unit 42 Hildegard Malware)(Citation: Trend Micro TeamTNT)(Citation: ATT TeamTNT Chimaera September 2020)(Citation: Aqua TeamTNT August 2020)(Citation: Intezer TeamTNT Explosion September 2021) |
| TeamTNT | `misp::27de6a09-844b-4dcb-9ff9-7292aad826ba` | ('misp',) | In early Febuary, 2021 TeamTNT launched a new campaign against Docker and Kubernetes environments. Using a collection of container images that are hosted in Docker Hub, the attackers are targeting misconfigured docker daemons, Kubeflow dashboards, and Weave Scope, exploiting these environments in order to steal cloud credentials, open backdoors, mine cryptocurrency, and launch a worm that is looking for the next victim. They're linked to the First Crypto-Mining Worm to Steal AWS Credentials and Hildegard Cryptojacking malware. TeamTNT is a relatively recent addition to a growing number of threats targeting the cloud. While they employ some of the same tactics as similar groups, TeamTNT stands out with their social media presence and penchant for self-promotion. Tweets from the TeamTNT’s account are in both English and German although it is unknown if they are located in Germany. |

Significant operations include the 2016 Bank of Bangladesh heist, during which [APT38](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082) stole $81 million, as well as attacks against Bancomext (Citation: FireEye APT38 Oct 2018) and Banco de Chile (Citation: FireEye APT38 Oct 2018); some of their attacks have been destructive.(Citation: CISA AA20-239A BeagleBoyz August 2020)(Citation: FireEye APT38 Oct 2018)(Citation: DOJ North Korea Indictment Feb 2021)(Citation: Kaspersky Lazarus Under The Hood Blog 2017)  North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) instead of tracking clusters or subgroups. |
| Lazarus Group | `misp::68391641-859f-4a9a-9a1e-3e5cf71ec376` | ('misp',) | Since 2009, HIDDEN COBRA actors have leveraged their capabilities to target and compromise a range of victims; some intrusions have resulted in the exfiltration of data while others have been disruptive in nature. Commercial reporting has referred to this activity as Lazarus Group and Guardians of Peace. Tools and capabilities used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware. Variants of malware and tools used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include Destover, Duuzer, and Hangman. |

Earlier this year, Mandiant published a blog on a fast-moving adversary deploying RYUK ransomware, UNC1878. Shortly after its release, there was a significant decrease in observed UNC1878 intrusions and RYUK activity overall almost completely vanishing over the summer. But beginning in early fall, Mandiant has seen a resurgence of RYUK along with TTP overlaps indicating that UNC1878 has returned from the grave and resumed their operations. |

| `T1053.003` | [Scheduled Task/Job: Cron](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003) | Adversaries may abuse the <code>cron</code> utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.(Citation: 20 macOS Common Tools and Techniques) The <code>cron</code> utility is a time-based job scheduler for Unix-like operating systems.  The <code> crontab</code> file contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and the specified times for execution. Any <code>crontab</code> files are stored in operating system-specific file paths.  An adversary may use <code>cron</code> in Linux or Unix environments to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003). In ESXi environments, cron jobs must be created directly via the crontab file (e.g., `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root`).(Citation: CloudSEK ESXiArgs 2023) |
