## Description
This technique describes how adversaries obtain information about user accounts 
in Azure Active Directory (AAD), which can be leveraged for further attack planning 
and targeting within a cloud environment.

### Example Attack Scenario

An attacker with limited or no access to an Azure environment targets an organization 
using Azure Active Directory. After they obtain information, attackers then cross-references 
this information with social media profiles and other public data, building a list 
of high-value users and their roles. Armed with these details, the attacker crafts 
targeted phishing campaigns or searches for weak credentials and misconfigurations 
with those accounts. For example, the attacker might use an Azure API such as `Get-AzureADUser` 
to enumerate users if they have a valid credential, or scrape corporate websites 
for employee contact details, inferring Azure AD presence.

### Attack Goals and Impact

- **Primary Goal:** To obtain as much information about users as possible—especially 
privileged or high-value accounts—without alerting defenders.
- **Impact:**
  - Enables targeted social engineering, phishing attacks, and credential stuffing.
  - Helps attackers identify privilege relationships, which aids in lateral movement 
  planning and privilege escalation.
  - Reveals organizational structure, making subsequent attacks more precise and effective.
  - May lead to sensitive data exposure (including personal information if the account 
  is later compromised).

### Attack Flow and Methodology

1. **Discovery & Enumeration:**
  - Attacker passively searches public sources (corporate sites, LinkedIn) for names, 
  roles, group memberships.
  - If attacker obtains a valid account/credential (through phishing or prior compromise), 
  they may use Azure AD enumeration APIs (`Get-AzureADUser`, etc.) to list all 
  users, roles, and privileges.

2. **Data Aggregation:**
  - Combine enumerated internal data (user lists, group memberships) with external 
  information (social media, breached databases).
  - Map relationships and find which users have critical access, such as global 
  administrators, application owners, or service principal managers.

3. **Analysis & Targeting:**
  - Identify users who are most likely susceptible to social engineering (frequently contacted staff, IT helpdesk).
  - Prioritize accounts for further compromise attempts based on access level.

4. **Preparation for Further Attack Phases:**
  - Use gathered user information to launch credential stuffing, spear phishing, 
  consent phishing, or authentication token theft attacks.
  - Attempt further reconnaissance focused on those high-value targets, such as 
  checking group assignment, roles, and recent activity.

## Criticality
**High** - A High priority incident is likely to result in a demonstrable impact to public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence.

## Terrain
Adversaries use publicly accessible endpoints, misconfigured applications, or phishing 
emails to harvest user names, email addresses, job titles, and group memberships.

## ATT&CK Techniques
| Technique | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `T1589` | [Gather Victim Identity Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589) | Adversaries may gather information about the victim's identity that can be used during targeting. Information about identities may include a variety of details, including personal data (ex: employee names, email addresses, security question responses, etc.) as well as sensitive details such as credentials or multi-factor authentication (MFA) configurations.  Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598). Information about users could also be enumerated via other active means (i.e. [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595)) such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames in a system or permitted MFA /methods associated with those usernames.(Citation: GrimBlog UsernameEnum)(Citation: Obsidian SSPR Abuse 2023) Information about victims may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)).(Citation: OPM Leak)(Citation: Register Deloitte)(Citation: Register Uber)(Citation: Detectify Slack Tokens)(Citation: Forbes GitHub Creds)(Citation: GitHub truffleHog)(Citation: GitHub Gitrob)(Citation: CNET Leaks)  Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Compromise Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)). |
| `T1087` | [Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087) | Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of valid accounts, usernames, or email addresses on a system or within a compromised environment. This information can help adversaries determine which accounts exist, which can aid in follow-on behavior such as brute-forcing, spear-phishing attacks, or account takeovers (e.g., [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)).  Adversaries may use several methods to enumerate accounts, including abuse of existing tools, built-in commands, and potential misconfigurations that leak account names and roles or permissions in the targeted environment.  For examples, cloud environments typically provide easily accessible interfaces to obtain user lists.(Citation: AWS List Users)(Citation: Google Cloud - IAM Servie Accounts List API) On hosts, adversaries can use default [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) and other command line functionality to identify accounts. Information about email addresses and accounts may also be extracted by searching an infected system’s files. |
| `T1078.004` | [Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004) | Valid accounts in cloud environments may allow adversaries to perform actions to achieve Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other identity sources such as Windows Active Directory.(Citation: AWS Identity Federation)(Citation: Google Federating GC)(Citation: Microsoft Deploying AD Federation)  Service or user accounts may be targeted by adversaries through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110), [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566), or various other means to gain access to the environment. Federated or synced accounts may be a pathway for the adversary to affect both on-premises systems and cloud environments - for example, by leveraging shared credentials to log onto [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021). High privileged cloud accounts, whether federated, synced, or cloud-only, may also allow pivoting to on-premises environments by leveraging SaaS-based [Software Deployment Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072) to run commands on hybrid-joined devices.  An adversary may create long lasting [Additional Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001) on a compromised cloud account to maintain persistence in the environment. Such credentials may also be used to bypass security controls such as multi-factor authentication.   Cloud accounts may also be able to assume [Temporary Elevated Cloud Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005) or other privileges through various means within the environment. Misconfigurations in role assignments or role assumption policies may allow an adversary to use these mechanisms to leverage permissions outside the intended scope of the account. Such over privileged accounts may be used to harvest sensitive data from online storage accounts and databases through [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009) or other methods. For example, in Azure environments, adversaries may target Azure Managed Identities, which allow associated Azure resources to request access tokens. By compromising a resource with an attached Managed Identity, such as an Azure VM, adversaries may be able to [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)s to move laterally across the cloud environment.(Citation: SpecterOps Managed Identity 2022) |
