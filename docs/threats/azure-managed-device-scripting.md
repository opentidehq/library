## Description
The following threat vector involves adversaries abusing device management capabilities 
to execute code on devices through services like Intune and Entra ID (AzureAD).

## Example Attack Scenario

An attacker who gains administrative access to AzureAD or Intune can deploy PowerShell 
or Python scripts to managed devices. For example, a compromised AzureAD account 
with device management rights could push a malicious PowerShell script to employee 
laptops using Intune, which then installs ransomware or exfiltrates sensitive data 
without user interaction.

## Attack Goals and Impact

The primary goal is to achieve **remote code execution** across a fleet of managed 
devices. Attackers may aim to:
- Steal credentials or sensitive files
- Install persistence mechanisms for future access
- Deploy ransomware, spyware, or other malware
This can lead to widespread compromise, significant data breaches, and business 
disruption, particularly because device scripting can touch many endpoints simultaneously.

## Attack Flow and Methodology

1. Use administrative capabilities (such as `microsoft.directory/devices/basic/update`) 
to push scripts to selected managed devices.
2. The scripts execute with system-level privileges if the targeting configuration 
is misused, allowing the attacker to harvest data, pivot to other internal resources, 
or further entrench their presence.
3. Attackers may cover tracks by modifying or deleting audit logs accessible through IntuneAuditLogs.

## Criticality
**High** - A High priority incident is likely to result in a demonstrable impact to public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence.

## Terrain
Adversaries obtain elevated access within AzureAD or Intune; often
via credential theft, privilege escalation, or social engineering.

| APT19 | `misp::066d25c1-71bd-4bd4-8ca7-edbba00063f4` | ('misp',) | Adversary group targeting financial, technology, non-profit organisations. |
| APT28 | `misp::5b4ee3ea-eee3-4c8e-8323-85ae32658754` | ('misp',) | The Sofacy Group (also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear and Sednit) is a cyber espionage group believed to have ties to the Russian government. Likely operating since 2007, the group is known to target government, military, and security organizations. It has been characterized as an advanced persistent threat. |
| APT29 | `misp::b2056ff0-00b9-482e-b11c-c771daa5f28a` | ('misp',) | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss). ' |

| APT31 | `misp::6bf7e6b6-5917-45a6-9567-f0baba79768c` | ('misp',) | FireEye characterizes APT31 as an actor specialized on intellectual property theft, focusing on data and projects that make a particular organization competetive in its field. Based on available data (April 2016), FireEye assesses that APT31 conducts network operations at the behest of the Chinese Government. Also according to Crowdstrike, this adversary is suspected of continuing to target upstream providers (e.g., law firms and managed service providers) to support additional intrusions against high-profile assets. In 2018, CrowdStrike observed this adversary using spear-phishing, URL “web bugs” and scheduled tasks to automate credential harvesting. |

## ATT&CK Techniques
| Technique | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `T1059` | [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) | Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004) while Windows installations include the [Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).  There are also cross-platform interpreters such as [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006), as well as those commonly associated with client applications such as [JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007) and [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005).  Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. Commands and scripts can be embedded in [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001) payloads delivered to victims as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells, as well as utilize various [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) in order to achieve remote Execution.(Citation: Powershell Remote Commands)(Citation: Cisco IOS Software Integrity Assurance - Command History)(Citation: Remote Shell Execution in Python) |
| `T1021` | [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) | Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to log into a service that accepts remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and VNC. The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.  In an enterprise environment, servers and workstations can be organized into domains. Domains provide centralized identity management, allowing users to login using one set of credentials across the entire network. If an adversary is able to obtain a set of valid domain credentials, they could login to many different machines using remote access protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP).(Citation: SSH Secure Shell)(Citation: TechNet Remote Desktop Services) They could also login to accessible SaaS or IaaS services, such as those that federate their identities to the domain, or management platforms for internal virtualization environments such as VMware vCenter.   Legitimate applications (such as [Software Deployment Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072) and other administrative programs) may utilize [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) to access remote hosts. For example, Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) on macOS is native software used for remote management. ARD leverages a blend of protocols, including [VNC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005) to send the screen and control buffers and [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004) for secure file transfer.(Citation: Remote Management MDM macOS)(Citation: Kickstart Apple Remote Desktop commands)(Citation: Apple Remote Desktop Admin Guide 3.3) Adversaries can abuse applications such as ARD to gain remote code execution and perform lateral movement. In versions of macOS prior to 10.14, an adversary can escalate an SSH session to an ARD session which enables an adversary to accept TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) prompts without user interaction and gain access to data.(Citation: FireEye 2019 Apple Remote Desktop)(Citation: Lockboxx ARD 2019)(Citation: Kickstart Apple Remote Desktop commands) |
| `T1078` | [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) | Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW) Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.  In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.(Citation: CISA MFA PrintNightmare)  The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.(Citation: TechNet Credential Theft) |

### Chaining details
#### succeeds -> [Azure - Gather Role Information](azure-gather-role-information.md) (`140907eb-c9fb-4330-9d71-656422388b2b`) (`sequence::succeeds`)
Adversaries need to identify privileged accounts and misconfigured role 
assignments that can be exploited for privilege escalation.

- **Target UUID**: `140907eb-c9fb-4330-9d71-656422388b2b`
#### succeeds -> [Azure - Gather Resource Data](azure-gather-resource-data.md) (`b1593e0b-1b3b-462d-9ab6-21d1c136469d`) (`sequence::succeeds`)
The attacker obtains credentials (via phishing, password spray, leaked keys)
granting at least Reader access to the target Azure tenant.

- **Target UUID**: `b1593e0b-1b3b-462d-9ab6-21d1c136469d`
#### succeeds -> [Azure - Valid Credentials](azure-valid-credentials.md) (`2743bf18-3b86-4721-bf3e-153dcda0b149`) (`sequence::succeeds`)
Adversaries obtain the username and password of an AzureAD user either through
phishing, password spraying, brute-force attacks, or credentials leaked online.

- **Target UUID**: `2743bf18-3b86-4721-bf3e-153dcda0b149`
#### preceeds -> [Code execution via custom script extensions in Azure](code-execution-via-custom-script-extensions-in-azure.md) (`61ddc240-e5a6-4ca8-ae77-6b471b498913`) (`sequence::preceeds`)
Adversaries must have an Azure role that grants the ability to write or deploy 
custom script extensions on virtual machines.

- **Target UUID**: `61ddc240-e5a6-4ca8-ae77-6b471b498913`
#### preceeds -> [Persistence with Azure Automanage Machine Configuration](persistence-with-azure-automanage-machine-configuration.md) (`23f6a192-a25d-48b8-a235-7bb55e483682`) (`sequence::preceeds`)
The adversary needs the owner access role on the targeted Azure subscription to apply
the Azure Policy and grant permissions for the system-managed identities.

- **Target UUID**: `23f6a192-a25d-48b8-a235-7bb55e483682`
