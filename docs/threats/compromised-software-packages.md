## Description
Compromised software packages in a supply chain attack refer to the
intentional or unintentional inclusion of malicious code or vulnerabilities
in software components, libraries, or dependencies that are used by multiple
organizations or products. This type of attack targets the software supply
chain, which includes all the organizations, people, and processes involved
in designing, developing, testing, building, delivering, and maintaining
software.

### Types of compromised software packages

- Malicious libraries or dependencies: Open-source or third-party libraries
that contain malicious code, which can be used to steal sensitive data,
disrupt operations, or create backdoors.
- Tampered software updates: Legitimate software updates that have been
compromised by an attacker, allowing them to inject malware or backdoors
into the updated software.
- Infected software components: Software components, such as DLLs or
executables, that contain malware or vulnerabilities, which can be
used to compromise the entire system.
- Fake or counterfeit software: Software that is intentionally designed
to mimic legitimate software, but contains malware or vulnerabilities.
- Typosquatting attacks: This type of approach includes a small changes
in the name of the software packages. In this way is very difficult to
recognise a malicious from a legitimate software package for installation.
The packages with names similar to legitimate ones could be deceiving and
easily lure the victim to download and use them. 

### Dependency poisoning 

Threat actors can add intentional vulnerabilities to open-source libraries
by exploiting their accessibility. Such example is typosquatting attacks
in which an adversary uploads malicious packages with names similar to
popular NPM or PyPI libraries to trick developers into downloading
the wrong one. Threat actors can also inject malicious code into trusted
libraries,for example: Log4j, NPM, or PyPI, compromising thousands of
applications that rely on them. This type of attack, often referred
to as “supply chain poisoning,” can have a massive impactful
consequences. ref [2].  

It's recommended a security officer to establish robust policies for
evaluating, approving, and managing open-source libraries. This includes
selecting packages from trusted sources and monitoring their activity.

## Criticality
**High** - A High priority incident is likely to result in a demonstrable impact to public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence.

## Terrain
> **A threat actor can use vulnerabilities in the function and appearance
of software malicious dev packages to entice a developer to install them.

## Actors
| Actor | ID | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UNC2452 | `misp::2ee5ed7a-c4d0-40be-a837-20817474a15b` | ('misp',) | Reporting regarding activity related to the SolarWinds supply chain injection has grown quickly since initial disclosure on 13 December 2020. A significant amount of press reporting has focused on the identification of the actor(s) involved, victim organizations, possible campaign timeline, and potential impact. The US Government and cyber community have also provided detailed information on how the campaign was likely conducted and some of the malware used.  MITRE’s ATT&CK team — with the assistance of contributors — has been mapping techniques used by the actor group, referred to as UNC2452/Dark Halo by FireEye and Volexity respectively, as well as SUNBURST and TEARDROP malware. |
| APT29 | `misp::b2056ff0-00b9-482e-b11c-c771daa5f28a` | ('misp',) | A 2015 report by F-Secure describe APT29 as: 'The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss). ' |

Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributes this campaign with high confidence to HAFNIUM, a group assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China, based on observed victimology, tactics and procedures. HAFNIUM has previously compromised victims by exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers, and has used legitimate open-source frameworks, like Covenant, for command and control. Once they’ve gained access to a victim network, HAFNIUM typically exfiltrates data to file sharing sites like MEGA.In campaigns unrelated to these vulnerabilities, Microsoft has observed HAFNIUM interacting with victim Office 365 tenants. While they are often unsuccessful in compromising customer accounts, this reconnaissance activity helps the adversary identify more details about their targets’ environments. HAFNIUM operates primarily from leased virtual private servers (VPS) in the United States. |

## ATT&CK Techniques
| Technique | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `T1546.016` | [Event Triggered Execution: Installer Packages](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/016) | Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content. Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed. Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.(Citation: Installer Package Scripting Rich Trouton)  Using legitimate applications, adversaries have distributed applications with modified installer scripts to execute malicious content. When a user installs the application, they may be required to grant administrative permissions to allow the installation. At the end of the installation process of the legitimate application, content such as macOS `postinstall` scripts can be executed with the inherited elevated permissions. Adversaries can use these scripts to execute a malicious executable or install other malicious components (such as a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)) with the elevated permissions.(Citation: Application Bundle Manipulation Brandon Dalton)(Citation: wardle evilquest parti)(Citation: Windows AppleJeus GReAT)(Citation: Debian Manual Maintainer Scripts)  Depending on the distribution, Linux versions of package installer scripts are sometimes called maintainer scripts or post installation scripts. These scripts can include `preinst`, `postinst`, `prerm`, `postrm` scripts and run as root when executed.  For Windows, the Microsoft Installer services uses `.msi` files to manage the installing, updating, and uninstalling of applications. These installation routines may also include instructions to perform additional actions that may be abused by adversaries.(Citation: Microsoft Installation Procedures) |
| `T1195` | [Supply Chain Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195) | Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.  Supply chain compromise can take place at any stage of the supply chain including:  * Manipulation of development tools * Manipulation of a development environment * Manipulation of source code repositories (public or private) * Manipulation of source code in open-source dependencies * Manipulation of software update/distribution mechanisms * Compromised/infected system images (multiple cases of removable media infected at the factory)(Citation: IBM Storwize)(Citation: Schneider Electric USB Malware)  * Replacement of legitimate software with modified versions * Sales of modified/counterfeit products to legitimate distributors * Shipment interdiction  While supply chain compromise can impact any component of hardware or software, adversaries looking to gain execution have often focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in software distribution or update channels.(Citation: Avast CCleaner3 2018)(Citation: Microsoft Dofoil 2018)(Citation: Command Five SK 2011) Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.(Citation: Symantec Elderwood Sept 2012)(Citation: Avast CCleaner3 2018)(Citation: Command Five SK 2011) Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may also be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.(Citation: Trendmicro NPM Compromise) |
