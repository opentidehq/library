## Description
Disable Swapping/Paging Devices is a tactic adversaries may employ to impair defenses, 
hamper forensic analyses, or disrupt normal system operations. 
By turning off, deleting, or misconfiguring the system’s paging file or swap space, 
malicious actors can limit the ability of the operating system to manage memory efficiently.  

## Evade Detection : Certain security tools or analysis processes rely on paging 
and memory snapshots. Disabling the swap or page file can complicate memory captures, 
obstructing forensic investigators from retrieving certain artifacts.  

## Cause Operational Instability : Without a functioning page file, systems may slow down 
or crash once physical RAM is fully consumed. This can be used intentionally to disrupt 
business operations or create an opening for other malicious activities 
while defenders are distracted.  

## Hide Malicious Components : Some malware frameworks attempt to evade detection 
by maintaining all malicious code in volatile memory. If system memory is not paged to disk, 
there is a slimmer trail of evidence left in permanent storage (e.g., pagefile.sys in Windows).  

### Windows 
```powershell
wmic computersystem where name="%computername%" set AutomaticManagedPagefile=False
wmic pagefileset where name="C:\\pagefile.sys" delete
```
This sequence disables the automatic page file management 
and removes the page file on the C: drive.

### Linux
```bash
swapoff -a
sed -i '/swap/d' /etc/fstab
```
This one disable all swap spaces and remove swap references from `/etc/fstab`, 
ensuring the change persists on reboot.

## Criticality
**High** - A High priority incident is likely to result in a demonstrable impact to public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence.

## Terrain
> **The attacker requires administrative privileges on the target operating system 
to modify or disable the system paging or swap settings. 
They may also need to leverage local management tools or scripts 
to carry out these modifications.

## ATT&CK Techniques
| Technique | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `T1562.001` | [Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001) | Adversaries may modify and/or disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their malware/tools and activities. This may take many forms, such as killing security software processes or services, modifying / deleting Registry keys or configuration files so that tools do not operate properly, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information. Adversaries may also disable updates to prevent the latest security patches from reaching tools on victim systems.(Citation: SCADAfence_ransomware)  Adversaries may also tamper with artifacts deployed and utilized by security tools. Security tools may make dynamic changes to system components in order to maintain visibility into specific events. For example, security products may load their own modules and/or modify those loaded by processes to facilitate data collection. Similar to [Indicator Blocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006), adversaries may unhook or otherwise modify these features added by tools (especially those that exist in userland or are otherwise potentially accessible to adversaries) to avoid detection.(Citation: OutFlank System Calls)(Citation: MDSec System Calls) Alternatively, they may add new directories to an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool’s exclusion list, enabling them to hide malicious files via [File/Path Exclusions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/012).(Citation: BlackBerry WhisperGate 2022)(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence FIN13 2021)  Adversaries may also focus on specific applications such as Sysmon. For example, the “Start” and “Enable” values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\EventLog-Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational</code> may be modified to tamper with and potentially disable Sysmon logging.(Citation: disable_win_evt_logging)   On network devices, adversaries may attempt to skip digital signature verification checks by altering startup configuration files and effectively disabling firmware verification that typically occurs at boot.(Citation: Fortinet Zero-Day and Custom Malware Used by Suspected Chinese Actor in Espionage Operation)(Citation: Analysis of FG-IR-22-369)  In cloud environments, tools disabled by adversaries may include cloud monitoring agents that report back to services such as AWS CloudWatch or Google Cloud Monitor.  Furthermore, although defensive tools may have anti-tampering mechanisms, adversaries may abuse tools such as legitimate rootkit removal kits to impair and/or disable these tools.(Citation: chasing_avaddon_ransomware)(Citation: dharma_ransomware)(Citation: demystifying_ryuk)(Citation: doppelpaymer_crowdstrike) For example, adversaries have used tools such as GMER to find and shut down hidden processes and antivirus software on infected systems.(Citation: demystifying_ryuk)  Additionally, adversaries may exploit legitimate drivers from anti-virus software to gain access to kernel space (i.e. [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068)), which may lead to bypassing anti-tampering features.(Citation: avoslocker_ransomware) |
