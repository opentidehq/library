## Description
System Network Configuration Discovery refers to an adversary’s effort to gather
and enumerate network-related information from compromised systems. This activity 
is often a precursor to more aggressive tactics, including lateral movement 
or data exfiltration. By executing commands or employing specific utilities to 
determine active network interfaces, routing tables, firewall states, and open ports, 
threat actors can map out an organization’s network architecture. 
This information allows them to identify potential choke points, pivot opportunities, 
and security gaps that could be exploited in subsequent stages of an attack.

## Common Tools & Commands
### Windows  

1) cmd.exe:
  - `ipconfig` to display IP addresses and network interfaces. 
  - `netstat` to list active TCP/UDP connections and listening ports.
  - `route print` to display routing tables.  

2) powershell.exe: 
  - `Get-NetIPConfiguration` to display IP addresses and network interfaces. 
  - `Get-NetTCPConnection` to display active network connections.
  - `Get-NetRoute` to display routing tables.  

3) netsh.exe: 
  - `netsh interface ip show config` for advanced interface information. 
  - `netsh interface ip show dns` to display DNS settings.

4) nslookup.exe: 
  - `nslookup <domain_name>` to display DNS records for a domain name. 

5) wmic.exe: 
  - `wmic nic get` to display network interface settings.
  - `wmic route get` to display routing tables.

### Linux and macOS 
  - `ifconfig` or `ip` to show IP address configuration and network interfaces.  
  - `arp` to examine the ARP table for link-layer address mapping.  
  - `netstat` or `ss` to display active connections and listening services.  
  - `route` to view or modify the IP routing table.  
  - `iptables`, `firewall-cmd`, `ufw` to query or adjust firewall settings.  
  - `dig` to query DNS servers and display DNS records.

## Criticality
**High** - A High priority incident is likely to result in a demonstrable impact to public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence.

## Terrain
> **Adversary must have the capability to run network configuration commands on 
endpoints or servers, potentially with elevated privileges

| UNC2452 | `misp::2ee5ed7a-c4d0-40be-a837-20817474a15b` | ('misp',) | Reporting regarding activity related to the SolarWinds supply chain injection has grown quickly since initial disclosure on 13 December 2020. A significant amount of press reporting has focused on the identification of the actor(s) involved, victim organizations, possible campaign timeline, and potential impact. The US Government and cyber community have also provided detailed information on how the campaign was likely conducted and some of the malware used.  MITRE’s ATT&CK team — with the assistance of contributors — has been mapping techniques used by the actor group, referred to as UNC2452/Dark Halo by FireEye and Volexity respectively, as well as SUNBURST and TEARDROP malware. |
| [[Enterprise] TeamTNT](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0139) | `att&ck::G0139` | ('att&ck',) | [TeamTNT](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0139) is a threat group that has primarily targeted cloud and containerized environments. The group as been active since at least October 2019 and has mainly focused its efforts on leveraging cloud and container resources to deploy cryptocurrency miners in victim environments.(Citation: Palo Alto Black-T October 2020)(Citation: Lacework TeamTNT May 2021)(Citation: Intezer TeamTNT September 2020)(Citation: Cado Security TeamTNT Worm August 2020)(Citation: Unit 42 Hildegard Malware)(Citation: Trend Micro TeamTNT)(Citation: ATT TeamTNT Chimaera September 2020)(Citation: Aqua TeamTNT August 2020)(Citation: Intezer TeamTNT Explosion September 2021) |
| TeamTNT | `misp::27de6a09-844b-4dcb-9ff9-7292aad826ba` | ('misp',) | In early Febuary, 2021 TeamTNT launched a new campaign against Docker and Kubernetes environments. Using a collection of container images that are hosted in Docker Hub, the attackers are targeting misconfigured docker daemons, Kubeflow dashboards, and Weave Scope, exploiting these environments in order to steal cloud credentials, open backdoors, mine cryptocurrency, and launch a worm that is looking for the next victim. They're linked to the First Crypto-Mining Worm to Steal AWS Credentials and Hildegard Cryptojacking malware. TeamTNT is a relatively recent addition to a growing number of threats targeting the cloud. While they employ some of the same tactics as similar groups, TeamTNT stands out with their social media presence and penchant for self-promotion. Tweets from the TeamTNT’s account are in both English and German although it is unknown if they are located in Germany. |

## ATT&CK Techniques
| Technique | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `T1016` | [System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016) | Adversaries may look for details about the network configuration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC addresses, of systems they access or through information discovery of remote systems. Several operating system administration utilities exist that can be used to gather this information. Examples include [Arp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0099), [ipconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0100)/[ifconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0101), [nbtstat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0102), and [route](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0103).  Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to gather information about configurations and settings, such as IP addresses of configured interfaces and static/dynamic routes (e.g. <code>show ip route</code>, <code>show ip interface</code>).(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A)(Citation: Mandiant APT41 Global Intrusion ) On ESXi, adversaries may leverage esxcli to gather network configuration information. For example, the command `esxcli network nic list` will retrieve the MAC address, while `esxcli network ip interface ipv4 get` will retrieve the local IPv4 address.(Citation: Trellix Rnasomhouse 2024)  Adversaries may use the information from [System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including determining certain access within the target network and what actions to do next. |
